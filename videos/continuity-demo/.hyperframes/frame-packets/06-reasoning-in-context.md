## Frame 6 — Reasoning in Context

- scene: Prometheus metrics, active chaos state, and a Loki 502 event converge into a reasoning theater that resolves on the diagnosed Fastly edge and ASN 3356 transit path.
- voiceover: "CONTINUITY invokes Gemini Enterprise with the metric vector, the active chaos state, and the latest edge log. The reasoning chain isolates an edge transit failure affecting the Fastly point of presence and transit ASN three three five six, then selects the exact remediation action."

- sfx: one ignition click echo, finite machine ticks, three resolving check tones

Adapt: keep the trigger-to-working-state-to-mutating-receipt signature; remove generic “thinking” filler and expose the actual input context, diagnosis, and selected action.
Scene 1 (0.0–3.2s): the outage capture sits as a full-frame evidence plane under a translucent central reasoning card; three input chips arrive only as named — `METRIC VECTOR`, `CHAOS STATE`, `LATEST LOKI EVENT` — with short-path staged entries.
Scene 2 (3.2–7.4s): a finite Gemini working indicator performs the computation while the chips connect inward; status text steps through `CORRELATE SIGNALS`, `ISOLATE FAULT DOMAIN`, and `SELECT REMEDIATION`.
Scene 3 (7.4–11.8s): the receipt expands downward (`anchored-layout-expand`) and reveals `FASTLY POP · US EAST`, then `TRANSIT ASN 3356`; numbered badges mutate into drawn checks one by one (`svg-path-draw`).
Scene 4 (11.8–15.0s): after a 0.5-second dramatic comma, the action row `SHIFT_TRAFFIC_TO_AKAMAI` expands into the focal slot; the diagnosis rows dim but remain auditable.
Scene 5 (15.0–17.0s): one controlled push tightens on the selected action and the exact incident context; the working indicator dies at resolution and the receipt holds static.

narrativeRole: Show how the diagnosis is grounded and how an action is selected.
keyMessage: Gemini reasons over incident context; it does not guess from a single alert.

## Selected blueprint: agent-progress-theater

# agent-progress-theater — Agent Progress Theater

**intent**: Agent work performed as WORKING-STATE theater — a short trigger beat hands the frame to the machine, which then visibly _works_: loaders spin, status phrases swap, dots pulse, counters tick — before the receipt arrives as a card whose rows cascade in and CHANGE STATE (badges flip to checks, labels strike through, severity pills read out), or as a conversation thread building message-by-message onto a camera push-in payoff. The subject is the machine performing labor over time. It is NOT a typed prompt awaiting output (no prompt/input is ever typed — the trigger is a click, a menu choice, or an already-running scan); NOT `cursor-ui-demo` (at most ONE igniting click here, then the cursor exits and the UI performs itself); NOT `grid-card-assemble` (rows there assemble into a static enumeration and hold — rows here are alive: they arrive as agent output and then MUTATE, checking off one by one while the viewer watches).

**roles served**

- Key_Feature (from `agent-progress-theater`): when the feature is the agent doing multi-step work (build a plan / scan a repo / fix a vulnerability / handle infra for you) and the proof is status theater — a loader lockup with a typed label, status couplets swapping under an `[accent]` spinner, then a checklist/findings card that populates and checks off in front of the viewer.
- Key_Feature (from `message-thread-payoff`): when the agent's work lives inside a conversation or automation thread — user/agent bubbles and tool-call/reply cards popping in sequence, the working state carried by pulsing loading dots or rapidly ticking diff counters, resolved by ONE camera push-in tight on the confirmation line (`[reaction pill]`, "Sent using `[@Bot]`", a thank-you bubble).

**duration**: 4.2–11.6s (short members are a single card-and-check-off or thread beat at ~4–5s; long members chain trigger → interstitial → status swaps → receipt card at ~9–12s; thread payoff spans 4.2–9.1s)

**shot structure** (a warm flat canvas — `[off-white / warm beige / near-white bg]`, optional `[faint grid / dot-grid / wavy-line]` texture; white rounded cards with soft drop shadows; ONE `[working accent]` color reserved for the machine (spinner, status words, active step) and one `[done color]` for completion (checks, "Completed"); camera static or ONE slow move — motion is overwhelmingly element-level springs, staggers, and state flips. Two folded sub-shapes — **(A) checklist/findings theater** and **(B) message-thread payoff**.)

- **Scene 1 (0.0–~1.5s) — the trigger.** Something asks the machine to work, in ONE beat:
  - _Variant — option menu (A)_: a centered white pill card poses `[the question]`; it SPRINGS open downward into a rounded menu — `[3–4 option rows]` fade/slide in staggered, each with a number badge. A cursor enters, hover-dances between rows (a pale `[hover fill]` highlight follows it), and CLICKS the chosen row (~press-down spring); the whole menu scales down toward its center and fades out. This is the only cursor appearance in the shot.
  - _Variant — modal click (A)_: close-up of a white modal with `[Dismiss]` / `[action button]`; a hand cursor clicks the action (quick press-down spring); the modal fades away. Optionally followed by a serif `[interstitial line]` on the bare canvas — words land staggered, hold, fade out word-staggered as the bg swaps.
  - _Variant — already working (A)_: a `[Scan in progress]`-style state — a thin `[accent]` arc spinner rotating over a heading + body copy + a `[Starting…]` pill (cursor resting on it, motionless); only the spinner moves. The whole scene then rapidly scales up and fades — a push-through exit.
  - _Variant — workspace push-through (A)_: a rapid camera push-in THROUGH a multi-panel `[workspace: builder / editor / terminal]` — panels scale past the viewport edges and clear away to the bare canvas.
  - _Variant — thread opener (B)_: a `[user bubble]` spring-pops in ("`[the ask]`"), OR a stats card pops in whose green/red `[diff counters]` rapidly tick and settle — the automation's opening receipt.

- **Scene 2 (~1–4s) — the working state (the machine performs).** The frame belongs to the machine; nothing is clickable. Pick 1–3 working motifs and CHAIN them:
  - A loader lockup: a spinning `[accent asterisk / arc]` beside a `[working label]` typed on rapidly ("`Buildi` → `Building plan…`"), a left→right shimmer sweep passing through the letters; the spinner may momentarily morph asterisk↔dot and back.
  - Status couplets: 2–3 centered pairs — a dark `[action line]` over an `[accent status word]` ("Thinking…", "Noodling…") with its spinner — swapping via quick fades/slides at a steady cadence.
  - A `[scan/tool label]` types/expands rightward to its full string, then SHRINKS and DOCKS to the top-left as a fixed corner header (the canvas now belongs to what it produces).
  - A status heading flips tense as rows land beneath it ("Using `[Tool]`" → "Used `[Tool]`"), with a gently pulsing "Thinking" and gray meta-lines ("Exploring `[N]` files…") fading in below.
  - _Variant — thread machinery (B)_: the `[agent reply]` fades/slides up, then a monospace `[tool_call]` line appears beneath it — small icon + `[tool name]` + three pulsing loading dots; OR an instruction bubble scrolls into view (internal window scroll, frame static) followed by a `[brand logo]` pop-in beside a "Sending message…" row. **The pulse dies the instant the result lands** — dots vanish as the payload arrives.

- **Scene 3 (~2–4s) — the receipt cascades in (the payoff engine).** The work materializes as a card that BUILDS:
  - _Variant — checklist (A)_: a white `[Progress / summary]` pill or card SPRING-pops in with a bounce, then springs open downward (or the summary card glides UP as a taller `[findings]` panel expands beneath it). Rows cascade in one by one — slide-up + fade, staggered — each with `[number badge / severity pill]` + `[label]` + optional gray `[meta line]`. Then the STATE MUTATION runs: badges flip one by one from numbered outline to a solid `[done color]` circle + white checkmark (slight scale bounce), the checked label simultaneously strikes through and dims; pending items keep partially-drawn arc outlines animating. End the run mid-list — some items checked, some still numbered — the work is visibly _ongoing_.
  - _Variant — thread payload (B)_: the camera pushes in / pans down centering the `[tool_call]` line as a white payload card expands downward from it — 2–4 light monospace `[key: value]` lines fading in. Then the `[resolution message]` expands into place below (inline `[code chips]` and `[link]` coloring), OR a dark `[thread card]` scales up from a status row to DOMINATE the frame while the background darkens, its `[reply]` expanding into place under a "1 reply" divider.

- **Scene 4 (final ~1–2.5s) — resolve.** Two endings:
  - _Variant — hold / scroll (A)_: the finished (or mid-mutation) card stack holds static to the end, OR the viewport scrolls down the final card (fast in the last beat) revealing `[a second heading + numbered list]`, ending mid-list. A slow continuous zoom into the card may run underneath (the header drifts off the top of frame).
  - _Variant — payoff push-in (B)_: ONE camera push-in + pan-down lands tight on the payoff line — "`Sent using [@Bot]`" / the confirmation + `[thank-you bubble]` spring-in — then a `[reaction button]` springs into an active pill with bouncy overshoot and a count. The push eases into a gentle near-imperceptible drift and the clip ends on the close-up. No end card.

**rule mapping**

- pill springs open downward into a menu / panel expands beneath a gliding card / payload card expands downward from a tool-call line → `anchored-layout-expand` (edge-anchored container growth: height-masked wrapper + inner counter-translate, container drawn at final size); spring flavor from `spring-pop-entrance`
- option rows / findings rows / task rows stagger in (slide-up + fade) → `spring-pop-entrance` (staggered-group form, ≤500ms cap) or `gsap-effects` (plain fade+translate stagger) — NOT `waterfall-entry` (its binary no-fade arrival law contradicts this dialect's soft fade/slide cascade)
- cursor glides to a row and clicks; hand cursor clicks the modal button → `cursor-click-ripple` (move + press) + `press-release-spring` (the button's press-down spring)
- pale hover-highlight fill following the cursor between rows → `gsap-effects` (a background fill translated row-to-row; no dedicated rule needed)
- menu scale-down fade exit / scene scale-up push-through exit / palette-for-window swap → `scale-swap-transition`
- thin arc spinner rotation / spinning asterisk loader → `svg-icon-enrichment` (rotating internal SVG parts via `setAttribute('transform','rotate(deg cx cy)')`; timeline-driven, finite)
- asterisk↔dot morph and back → `scale-swap-transition` (two elements morphing at the same center)
- typed-on loader label ("Building plan…") / scan label typing to its full string → `discrete-text-sequence` (+ `context-sensitive-cursor` for the caret)
- left→right shimmer sweep through the loader letters → `ambient-glow-bloom` (single-pass traveling sheen) or `css-marker-patterns` (highlight sweep) — pick sheen for light-on-text, marker for a drawn band
- serif interstitial word-staggered fade in/out; status couplets swapping on a cadence → `dynamic-content-sequencing` (phrase windows) + `discrete-text-sequence` (the whole-state swaps); per-word stagger via `gsap-effects`
- pulsing "Thinking" label / three pulsing loading dots (phase-offset) → `sine-wave-loop` (finite repeats; kill the tween at the resolve beat — see doctrine note)
- status heading tense flip (Using→Used) / gray meta-lines fading in / final-token snaps → `discrete-text-sequence`
- label shrinks and docks to the top-left as a fixed corner header → `gsap-effects` (plain scale + translate tween; no dedicated rule needed)
- rapid camera push-in through the multi-panel workspace → `viewport-change` (the push) + `multi-phase-camera` (phasing) + optional `motion-blur-streak` (velocity blur as panels clear the frame)
- slow continuous zoom into the receipt card (header drifts off top) → `multi-phase-camera` (steady-push phase) or `viewport-change`
- summary card / progress pill / chat bubble / brand logo / file chip spring pop-in → `spring-pop-entrance`
- summary card glides up as the findings panel expands beneath → `gsap-effects` (the glide) + `anchored-layout-expand` (the panel)
- badge flip: numbered outline → solid circle + white checkmark with scale bounce → `scale-swap-transition` (outline↔solid swap at same center) + `svg-path-draw` (checkmark draw-in) + `spring-pop-entrance` (the bounce); the pending→active→complete progression itself → `dynamic-content-sequencing` (a snap state machine, per cursor-ui-demo's workflow-approve-press precedent)
- strikethrough + dim on the checked label → `css-marker-patterns` (strike-through draw) + `gsap-effects` (opacity dim)
- partially-drawn arc outlines animating on pending items → `svg-path-draw` (partial dashoffset, held mid-draw)
- viewport scroll down the final card / internal window scroll under a static frame → `gsap-effects` (transform-only content translate inside a masked window) — use `viewport-change` only if the FRAME moves
- green/red diff counters rapid tick-and-settle → `counting-dynamic-scale` (numeric proxy count-up; suppress the scale-growth component — these tick at fixed size)
- dark thread card scales up from a row to dominate the frame → `card-morph-anchor` (row → full-frame morph + handoff) with the background darkening as a `gsap-effects` overlay fade
- reply message / resolution line expands into place → `spring-pop-entrance` (soft overshoot) or `anchored-layout-expand` for a true downward growth
- reaction button springs into an active pill with overshoot + count → `spring-pop-entrance` (the pop) + `press-release-spring` (activation flavor) + `counting-dynamic-scale` (the count, if it ticks)
- camera push-in + pan-down centering the tool call / the payoff line → `coordinate-target-zoom` (non-centered target: scale + counter-translate) or `viewport-change`
- slight pull-back then gentle end drift → `multi-phase-camera` (pull-back phase + continuous micro-drift; keep the drift near-imperceptible)
- static hold on the final stack → no rule needed

**camera modifier** (default is a STATIC frame — the theater is element-level; at most ONE real move per shot, chosen from):

- Trigger push-through: a rapid push-in through the opening workspace that clears to the bare canvas → `viewport-change` + `multi-phase-camera`, optional `motion-blur-streak`.
- Receipt zoom: one slow continuous zoom into the checklist card across the whole mutation run, letting the header drift off the top → `multi-phase-camera` (steady push).
- Payoff push-in (sub-shape B's defining move): static through the build, then ONE push-in + pan-down tightening onto the confirmation line, easing to a micro-drift end → `coordinate-target-zoom` / `viewport-change` + `multi-phase-camera` (drift).
- Everything else — swaps, cascades, check-offs, scrolls — happens on a locked frame (any "scroll" is the content translating inside its window, not the camera).

**doctrine note (idle-motion ban)**: the working-state motifs (spinner rotation, pulsing dots, pulsing "Thinking") brush against motion-doctrine's idle-motion ban — here they are DIEGETIC: the pulse _performs_ "the machine is working" and is the narrative content of Scene 2, not decorative breathing. Keep every loop finite, timeline-driven, and seek-safe (`sine-wave-loop` finite repeats, `svg-icon-enrichment` rotation), and kill it at the exact frame the state resolves — the corpus does this explicitly (the loading dots vanish the instant the payload card expands; the spinner swaps out with the loader lockup).

## Selected motion rule: anchored-layout-expand

---
name: anchored-layout-expand
description: Edge-pinned container grows (or collapses) along ONE axis and in-flow content reflows with it — a pill springs open downward into a dropdown, a panel grows a sub-task stack, an input card stretches as typed text wraps, a pane expands over a neighbor. Transform-only (mask + slide, or proxy-driven scaleY + counter-scale) because width/height tweens are forbidden; the push on subsequent content is a matched translate on the same tween.

# Anchored Layout Expand

> The law: **author the layout at its final (expanded) state in CSS, then fake the collapsed state with transforms.** The container never changes size — the _visible_ region does — and everything downstream rides a matched translate. The browser computes layout ONCE; every intermediate frame is pure transform.

THE one-axis growth primitive: a container pinned at one edge appears to grow along a single axis, and the in-flow content after it moves in perfect contact with the traveling edge — dropdown, sub-task stack, growing composer card, pane widening over a neighbor. Growth and push are ONE motion: if the panel's bottom edge and the pushed content ever separate or overlap, the illusion dies.

Distinct from [card-morph-anchor.md](card-morph-anchor.md) (a free-floating two-shot morph with no neighbors to push — this rule's container is a live layout participant), [spring-pop-entrance.md](spring-pop-entrance.md) (arrival at a point, no edge travel or reflow), and [reactive-displacement.md](reactive-displacement.md) (displacement by a colliding intruder; here content moves because the container's edge reached it — layout causality, not collision).

## How It Works

1. **Mask** — a wrapper at the final body height (`BODY_H`), `overflow: hidden`. Never tweened.
2. **Sheet** — the panel surface + content inside the mask, starting at `y: -BODY_H` (tucked above the mask window, behind the pinned header).
3. **Below** — ONE wrapper holding everything after the container, also starting at `y: -BODY_H`.
4. **Grow** — ONE `fromTo` drives sheet AND below from `y: -BODY_H → 0`. Shared tween ⇒ the descending bottom edge and the pushed content stay in exact contact by construction. Collapse = the same pair tweened back.

When the surface must visibly **stretch in place** (rows revealed top-first, or a pane growing sideways), use the proxy counter-scale variant below instead.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip (hyperframes-core) -->
<div class="stack">
  <div class="expander">
    <div class="expander-head">{headerLabel}</div>
    <div class="expand-mask" id="expand-mask" data-layout-allow-overflow>
      <div class="expand-sheet" id="expand-sheet">
        <div class="expand-row">{rowA}</div>
        <div class="expand-row">{rowB}</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <!-- EVERYTHING that must be pushed lives in this one wrapper -->
  <div class="below" id="below">{followingContent}</div>
</div>
```

```css
/* Layout is the EXPANDED end state — no collapsed geometry exists in CSS. */
.expander-head {
  position: relative;
  z-index: 2; /* the sheet slides out from UNDER the header */
}
.expand-mask {
  height: BODY_H; /* authored final height — NEVER tweened */
  overflow: hidden;
}
.expand-sheet {
  height: BODY_H;
  border-radius: 0 0 SHEET_RADIUS SHEET_RADIUS; /* bottom-only — header + sheet read as one grown card */
  will-change: transform; /* + on .below */
}
```

```js
// BODY_H must equal the mask's CSS height exactly — measure once at build.
// (Montage caveat: per the contract, in a multi-scene master use an authored
// CSS-matched constant instead — later clips may not be laid out yet.)
const BODY_H = document.querySelector("#expand-mask").offsetHeight;

// The grow: ONE tween, BOTH sides of the seam.
tl.fromTo(
  ["#expand-sheet", "#below"],
  { y: -BODY_H },
  { y: 0, duration: GROW_DUR, ease: GROW_EASE },
  GROW_AT,
);

// Garnish: rows already ride the sheet; the fade stagger makes them read as "options arriving".
tl.fromTo(
  ".expand-row",
  { opacity: 0 },
  { opacity: 1, duration: ROW_FADE_DUR, stagger: ROW_STAGGER, ease: "power2.out" },
  GROW_AT + GROW_DUR * 0.25,
);

// Collapse — same machinery back; faster (closing is a snap decision).
tl.fromTo(
  ["#expand-sheet", "#below"],
  { y: 0 },
  { y: -BODY_H, duration: COLLAPSE_DUR, ease: "power3.in", immediateRender: false },
  COLLAPSE_AT,
);
```

## Variations

- **Proxy counter-scale — surface stretches in place** (rows revealed top-first holding their screen positions; the "payload card expands from the tool-call line"). Drive mask `scaleY` and the sheet's exact inverse from ONE proxy — two independent tweens are wrong: eased midpoints of `s` and `1/s` are not inverses and the content squashes mid-grow. Net content scale is `s × 1/s = 1` every frame; seek-safe because everything derives from the one interpolated proxy.

  ```js
  const grow = { h: COLLAPSED_H }; // 0 for fully collapsed
  tl.fromTo(
    grow,
    { h: COLLAPSED_H },
    {
      h: BODY_H,
      duration: GROW_DUR,
      ease: GROW_EASE,
      onUpdate: () => {
        const s = Math.max(grow.h / BODY_H, 0.0001); // clamp: no divide-by-zero
        gsap.set("#expand-mask", { scaleY: s, transformOrigin: "50% 0%" });
        gsap.set("#expand-sheet", { scaleY: 1 / s, transformOrigin: "50% 0%" });
        gsap.set("#below", { y: grow.h - BODY_H });
      },
    },
    GROW_AT,
  );
  ```

- **One-axis pane expand (X)**: same machinery rotated 90° — pin the left edge, sheet from `x: -PANE_W` (or proxy `scaleX` + counter-scale, origin `0% 50%`). Decide the neighbor's fate explicitly: **overlap** (pane paints over it, no neighbor tween) or **push** (neighbor rides the same tween). Never both.
- **Typed-wrap growth** — the composer card gets taller as typed text wraps. Quantize: one short step per wrap boundary, each moving the pair by one `LINE_H`; wrap times come from the deterministic typing schedule ([discrete-text-sequence.md](discrete-text-sequence.md)), never measured at render time. Two battle-tested traps:
  - **Composer cards have no pinned header** — a composer grows from its TOP edge (the send-button footer stays put), so a plain y-step clips the card's top out of the mask. Combine the proxy counter-scale with the wrap quantization (step the proxy by `LINE_H` at each wrap time) and split the surface into a **sheet** (carries the top radius) + **footer** (carries the bottom radius) so the growth seam stays invisible.
  - **Wrap TIME vs wrap POSITION are two different authorities** — the typing schedule decides _when_ a wrap fires, the browser's line-breaking decides _where_ text actually wraps, and with proportional fonts they silently disagree. Author an explicit `\n` in the typed string (with `white-space: pre-wrap`) at the chosen split point so both derive from the same authored fact.
- **Springy open** (rare, explicitly-playful): `back.out(1.2)` — the edge overshoots a few px; the pushed content bounces with the panel (correct — they're in contact). Default stays `power3.out`.
- **Row grows a sub-task stack**: the row is the pinned header, the stack is the sheet, every later row lives in `#below`; chain several scopes for progressive disclosure.
- **FLIP hand-off**: if the container also TRAVELS to a new layout slot while resizing (prompt promoted to heading, card docking into a sidebar), that's a FLIP problem — `/hyperframes-keyframes` (FLIP recipes). This rule stays the in-place one-axis specialist.

## Values

| token                    | range                       | notes                                                                 |

## Critical Constraints

- **NEVER tween `width` / `height` / `top` / `left` / `margin` / `padding`** — the mask's height is a CSS constant; only its children transform. Tweening the mask IS the forbidden move this rule replaces.
- **`data-layout-allow-overflow` on the mask** — the collapsed phase parks the sheet outside the mask's box by construction, which trips the `hyperframes check` layout gate (`container_overflow`). The flag is the sanctioned waiver: this overflow is the technique working as designed, not a bug.
- **Sheet + below share one tween (or one proxy)** — matched-but-separate tweens on the two sides of the contact edge are the classic seam bug.
- **Everything downstream rides `#below`** — content outside the wrapper is overlapped at t=0 and orphaned during the grow.
- **`overflow: hidden` on the mask** — without it the tucked sheet is visible above the header at t=0.
- **Counter-scale needs a proxy**, clamped `s ≥ 0.0001` (a fully-collapsed body divides by zero).
- **Deterministic sizes** — `BODY_H`, `LINE_H`, `WRAP_TIMES` are build-time constants or one-time measurements, never per-frame layout reads.

# SVG Path Draw

Reveals an SVG shape by animating its stroke as if a pen were tracing it. Two stroke properties together: **`stroke-dasharray = <pathLength>`** makes the entire path one dash; **`stroke-dashoffset`** starts at the path length (dash shifted fully out of view → invisible) and tweens to `0` (fully drawn). The length comes from the DOM API `path.getTotalLength()` — measured, never guessed.

Works on anything with a stroke: `<path>`, `<circle>`, `<rect>`, `<line>`, `<polyline>`, `<polygon>`, `<ellipse>`.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip -->
<svg class="logo-mark" viewBox="0 0 200 200" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <path id="bar-left" d="M 60 40 L 60 160" />
  <path id="bar-right" d="M 140 40 L 140 160" />
  <path id="bar-mid" d="M 60 100 L 140 100" />
</svg>
```

```css
.logo-mark path {
  fill: none; /* outline-only draw — a fill would appear immediately and ruin the reveal */
  stroke: {accentColor};
  stroke-width: 12;
  stroke-linecap: round; /* softer endpoints */
  stroke-linejoin: round;
}
```

```js
// Setup: measure each path and set its dash pattern. Real measured geometry, not a magic number.
document.querySelectorAll(".logo-mark path").forEach((p) => {
  const len = p.getTotalLength();
  p.style.strokeDasharray = `${len}`;
  p.style.strokeDashoffset = `${len}`;
});

// Stagger draws so the eye reads continuous motion — each segment starts at
// ~70-80% of the previous segment's duration, before it finishes.
tl.to(
  "#bar-left",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_1_START,
);
tl.to(
  "#bar-right",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_2_START,
);
tl.to(
  "#bar-mid",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: FINAL_SEGMENT_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_3_START,
);

// Companion wordmark fades in only after the last stroke settles.
tl.to(
  ".brand-line",
  { opacity: 1, duration: BRAND_FADE_DUR, ease: "power1.out" },
  BRAND_FADE_START,
);
```

## Variations

- **Ring starting at 12 o'clock** — `<circle>` / `<rect>` strokes start at 3 o'clock by default; rotate the element `-90deg` so a progress ring draws from the top:

```html
<circle
  cx="100"
  cy="100"
  r="60"
  id="ring"
  style="transform-origin: 100px 100px; transform: rotate(-90deg)"
/>
```

- **Linear (constant-speed) draw** — `ease: "none"` for a steady-rate "real pen" trace.
- **Draw then fill** — for filled shapes, tween `fillOpacity: 0 → 1` AFTER the stroke completes (requires `fill-opacity: 0` initially and a real `fill` in CSS):

```js
tl.to(
  "#path",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_1_START,
);
tl.to(
  "#path",
  { fillOpacity: 1, duration: FILL_FADE_DUR, ease: "power1.out" },
  SEG_1_START + SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR,
);
```

## Values

| token             | range                                   | notes                                                                                              |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR  | 0.3–0.8s                                | fast snap vs deliberate pen trace; >~1s feels sluggish for a logo reveal                           |
| FINAL_SEGMENT_DUR | 60–80% of SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR              | proportional to segment length — a short connector at full duration reads slower than its siblings |
| SEG_N_START       | previous start + 70–80% of its duration | reads as continuous motion, not N isolated animations                                              |
| SEG_1_START       | 0–0.4s                                  | a small ~0.2s lead-in lets the viewer settle before motion                                         |
| BRAND_FADE_START  | ≥ last stroke end (+ ~0.2s beat)        | earlier and the wordmark competes with the draw                                                    |
| BRAND_FADE_DUR    | 0.3–0.8s                                | snap (urgent) vs glide (premium)                                                                   |

Ease families are discrete choices: **stroke draws** use `power2.out` (a hand lifting at end of stroke) or `none` for constant speed — never `back.out` / `elastic.out` (pens don't bounce). **Fades** use `power1.out`.

## Critical Constraints

- **`fill: none`** for outline-only draws — otherwise the fill appears immediately.
- **Dasharray/dashoffset = the measured `getTotalLength()`**, set at setup; requires the SVG in the DOM (inline SVG is fine; a loaded `<image>` SVG is not).
- **Complex paths**: if `getTotalLength()` looks wrong, overestimate slightly (`len * 1.05`) — too large is invisible at animation start; too small clips the end.
- **Stagger multi-path draws at ~70–80%** of the previous segment's duration.
- **A drawn line must land on something.** When the path is a connector (rail, beam, underline, callout) rather than a shape, both endpoints must sit on real elements and the draw must do a job — reveal, route, validate, or emphasize. A stroke that only decorates empty space reads as filler; attach it or cut it.
