## Frame 7 — Execute the Failover

- scene: A mechanical traffic-routing diagram moves egress from Fastly 100/0 to Fastly 20/Akamai 80, then hands off to the recovered product surface.
- voiceover: "No ticket handoff. No human approval queue. CONTINUITY executes shift traffic to Akamai. Primary egress drops to twenty percent. Secondary egress scales to eighty. Playback returns, and the incident record preserves the full reasoning trace."

- sfx: routed whoosh, two mechanical lock clicks, clean recovery chime

Adapt: keep the motivated multi-leg camera signature; the traffic control is the launch point and the recovered live surface is the consequence the camera travels to.
Scene 1 (0.0–3.1s): a large route manifold establishes to the right of the left-side presenter: `FASTLY 100` over `AKAMAI 0`; a hard green command label `SHIFT_TRAFFIC_TO_AKAMAI` locks underneath.
Scene 2 (3.1–6.0s): “No ticket handoff” and “No human approval queue” arrive as two crossed-out queue tokens, then clear on the same leftward current; the route lever becomes the sole focal control.
Scene 3 (6.0–9.5s): the camera dives through the control as the two numeric shares move in opposite value directions but one visual flow — Fastly to `20%`, Akamai to `80%` (`counting-dynamic-scale`, `stat-bars-and-fills`); the green path visibly redirects at the hinge.
Scene 4 (9.5–12.8s): the journey lands on the recovered command-center capture, straight-on and large; the real `20/80` split and restored state receive brief mint brackets while off-focus route geometry recedes.
Scene 5 (12.8–15.0s): `PLAYBACK RESTORED` draws in above the surface, followed by `REASONING TRACE PRESERVED`; the camera comes fully to rest and the recovered state holds.

narrativeRole: Deliver the autonomous action payoff and make the recovery visually undeniable.
keyMessage: CONTINUITY changes the system, not merely the alert status.

## Selected blueprint: camera-journey

# camera-journey — Camera Journey

**intent**: The real viewport camera is the STORYTELLER — a multi-leg journey (dive in → a mid-journey beat fires → travel to the consequence / reposition → landing push, at rest) across ONE continuous world, where the travel itself carries the narrative. Two folded sub-shapes: **(A) action roundtrip** — the camera dives into a UI panel, a cursor/typed action fires, and the camera swoops/pans to another region where the consequence renders as element motion; **(B) cursorless flight** — pure cinematic 3D flight (motion blur, depth-of-field, tilt-to-flatten rotations) over static or self-animating content, no cursor anywhere.

**boundary**: This is NOT `cursor-ui-demo` — there the camera _chases_ the cursor (a servo following the actor); here the camera IS the actor, moving on its own narrative motivation, and in sub-shape A the cursor acts only at the leg hinge (in B it never appears). This is NOT `device-surface-showcase` — there one DEVICE/surface is hero and the camera merely presents it; here no single surface is hero — the journey traverses multiple regions/panels/depth planes and the traversal is the story. This is NOT `spatial-pan-stations` — there pre-placed stations on a flat canvas are visited by repeated pans of the same type; here the legs are heterogeneous (push-in, swoop, pull-back-rotate, whip, dive) and each leg is _motivated_ (by a fired action, or by the reveal it lands on).

**roles served**

- Benefits (from `camera-swoop-panel-action-roundtrip`): when the benefit IS a cause→effect round trip — "do this small thing here, get this big thing there" (comment → chart morphs; agent finding → verified commit; chat message → receipt + ledger). The camera physically connects the action to its payoff, so the viewer _travels_ the value chain instead of being told it.
- Key_Feature (from `cursorless-camera-flight`): when the feature should feel cinematic and inevitable — a payout form or a generated content-plan calendar explored by a flying camera (dives, whip sweeps, tilt-to-flatten, violent final push onto the CTA/hero card), the content acting by itself (a dropdown self-selects; keyword cards simply exist in depth) with no hand on the wheel.

**duration**: 5.6–11.1s (sub-shape A 5.6–9.0s: 001 5.6s · 066 8.6s · 004 9.0s; sub-shape B 6.3–11.1s: Outrank 6.3s · 094 11.1s)

**shot structure** (one oversized `[world]` — a `[UI canvas: design tool / GitHub + agent panels / phone + desktop ledger]` (A) or a `[3D-laid-out space: floating form card / calendar grid with standing keyword cards]` (B) — wrapped by a single virtual camera; content animates as elements _inside_ the world while the camera travels; every leg is a sequential tween on the same camera state)

- **Scene 0 (optional, 0.0–~1.8s) — static prologue.** Camera locked on a `[prologue beat: static promo card with a floating 3D product card / typed headline with an accent word / wide establishing shot of the app]`. A typewriter line may finish (`[headline]` types on, accent word in `[accent color]`). The prologue BREAKS by a hard cut or by the headline shrinking and slipping away as the first dive begins — the stillness exists to make the journey's launch land.

- **Scene 1 (~0.5–2.0s) — LEG 1: dive in.** The camera pushes in FAST and TIGHT onto `[the focal element]`:
  - _Sub-shape A_: a flat whole-viewport push onto `[an actionable element: comment box / agent panel / chat bubble]` where `[typed text]` finishes typing or `[response text]` streams in. The header/context leaves the frame — commitment, not a polite zoom.
  - _Sub-shape B_: the push lands at an ANGLE — a tilted 3D close-up of `[the form region / the calendar grid]`, foreground elements motion-blurred during the travel, neighbors soft under depth-of-field. A huge `[foreground prop: date number / field label]` may dominate the frame, blurred by speed.

- **Scene 2 (~1.5–6.0s) — LEG 2: the mid-journey beat (the hinge).** The camera holds, drifts, or pulls slowly while the content ACTS:
  - _Sub-shape A — the action fires_: a `[cursor]` clicks `[Send / Create PR]` (or a `[message]` sends implicitly) and the acted element CLEARS/vanishes. Optional theater before the click: a `[status spinner]` cycles `[status words]`, `[to-do items]` strike through, `[response text]` streams. The click is the hinge that _motivates_ the next leg.
  - _Sub-shape B — the content self-acts_: a `[dropdown]` expands by itself (pushing `[the field below]` down), shows a `[row hover highlight]` with no cursor, and collapses with the new value selected; OR the flight decelerates INTO FOCUS on `[one card]` — its `[metrics]` sharp, neighboring cards blurred.

- **Scene 3 (~4.0–8.0s) — LEG 3: travel to the consequence / reposition.**
  - _Sub-shape A_: the camera pulls back / swoops / pans to `[region B]` while the CONSEQUENCE builds as element motion — `[bars shrink into the baseline while a node-dotted line draws left→right / a verified commit row slides into the timeline + a reaction pill pops / a receipt card expands row-by-row from a skeleton]`. An optional SECOND leg extends the trip: `[pan up-right to a toolbar → a dropdown cascades open / match cut into an extreme close-up → a fast decelerating zoom-out reveals a ledger table]`.
  - _Sub-shape B_: a repositioning move — a slow pull-back that ROTATES the world flat and centered (3D → straight-on 2D), or a heavily motion-blurred WHIP SWEEP that resolves into a flat lateral pan across `[a month calendar / the full card]`. On the flat hold, quiet element beats may play: a thin `[focus outline]` fades in around one `[field]` and sweeps down to the next; the card keeps a near-imperceptible tilt/scale drift so the hold never dies.

- **Scene 4 (final ~1–2s) — LEG 4: landing.** The journey resolves on the payoff:
  - _Sub-shape A_: the camera comes to REST; the `[cursor]` hovers or drifts toward `[the payoff: an open Export menu item / the commit link / the View-transaction button]`; ends still, on the changed state — the world is visibly different from where the trip began.
  - _Sub-shape B_: a sudden VIOLENT push-in/dive (motion-blurred) onto `[the CTA button scaled huge in frame / the hero keyword card]`, ending holding tight — or holding MID-DIVE (the last frames are still traveling; the flat overview is explicitly not the final image).

**motion vocabulary**: whole-viewport camera push-in (fast/tight and slow/subtle); camera pull-back reframe; camera pan up/right/down; dive/swoop between stacked panels; fast decelerating zoom-out to rest; sudden violent push-in onto a button scaled huge; continuous 3D flight through a card grid; dive into an angled 3D close-up; slow pull-back that rotates/flattens the world to straight-on; heavily motion-blurred whip sweep; motion blur on camera travel; depth-of-field with blurred neighbors; decelerate-into-focus; hard cut / match cut into extreme close-up; near-imperceptible tilt/scale drift on holds; typed text finishing in an input; typewriter headline; headline shrinks and slips away as the camera dives; streaming AI response text; status-word spinner cycling labels; to-do strikethrough draw; cursor click; clicked element clears/vanishes; dropdown cascades open / self-expands and collapses with a row hover highlight (displacing the field below); bar-to-line chart morph (bars shrink into the baseline while a node-dotted line draws left→right, labels persist); commit row slide-in on a timeline; reaction pill appears; skeleton→content card build; receipt/label rows expand row-by-row; thin focus outline fades in and sweeps between fields; camera drift toward a button; 3D card subtle float; cursor hover at rest.

**rule mapping**

- the multi-leg camera itself — sequential push / pull-back / pan / dive phases on one wrapper, plus the micro-drift that keeps holds alive → `multi-phase-camera` (phase sequencing + drift) over `viewport-change` (the base virtual-camera primitive: single `.world` wrapper, one `cam {scale,x,y}` state — one source of truth for every leg)
- diving TIGHT onto an off-center element (comment box, chat bubble, Send button, one keyword card) → `coordinate-target-zoom` (scale + counter-translate; measure the target, don't hand-derive — a journey amplifies centering error on every leg)
- fast decelerating zoom-out from an extreme close-up to rest (066's ledger reveal) → `coordinate-target-zoom` zoom-out variation / `multi-phase-camera` (pull phase, hard `power4.out`)
- motion blur on camera travel (dive, whip sweep, violent final push) → `motion-blur-streak` (Camera-travel carve-out — the blur envelope rides the `.world` wrapper during a leg: the world never leaves frame, the blur peaks at peak velocity and resolves sharp at each landing)
- depth-of-field on neighbors while one card is in focus; decelerate-into-focus → `depth-of-field-blur` (focal pull + blur-the-cluster-while-pushing-in are explicitly in scope; run the DoF tween at the same position as the camera leg)
- the 3D flight itself (sub-shape B's core) — a perspective camera traveling with `rotateX/rotateY/translateZ` through a 3D-laid-out world: the dive into an angled calendar grid, the tilt-to-flatten pull-back (angled 3D → straight-on 2D), the continuous flight between standing cards → `3d-camera-flight` (perspective wrapper + preserve-3d; the 2D camera rules keep owning any flat legs)
- whip sweep → composition: `nudge-curve` (burst-dominant tuning of the slow-fast-slow slide, applied to the world) + `motion-blur-streak` (camera-travel carve-out) on the same window
- typed text finishing in an input; typewriter headline; streaming AI response text; status spinner cycling `[status words]`; skeleton→content state swap → `discrete-text-sequence` (+ `gsap-effects` typewriter; `context-sensitive-cursor` for the input caret)
- which content appears per leg / receipt rows and findings arriving on script windows → `dynamic-content-sequencing`
- cursor click on `[Send / Create PR]` (sub-shape A's hinge) → `cursor-click-ripple` + `press-release-spring` (or `physics-press-reaction` for a weightier press)
- clicked element clears/vanishes; panel state A → B on the return leg → `scale-swap-transition` / `card-morph-anchor`
- to-do strikethrough draw; row hover highlight → `css-marker-patterns` (strike-through) · `asr-keyword-glow` (accent glow on the hovered/selected row)
- bar-to-line chart morph → composite, decomposes cleanly: `stat-bars-and-fills` (bars `scaleY` → baseline) + `svg-path-draw` (node-dotted line draws left→right) at the same timeline position — no single rule names the coordinated chart-type morph, but no new rule needed
- commit row slide-in; reaction pill appears; receipt rows expand row-by-row → `spring-pop-entrance` (single arrivals) / `waterfall-entry` (the row-by-row cascade)
- dropdown self-expands, displacing the field below (094) → `anchored-layout-expand` (the masked edge-anchored expansion of the dropdown body — never tween `height`) + `reactive-displacement` (the expansion tween drives the sibling's displacement)
- focus-ring travel between fields (094: a thin outline fades in on `From`, then sweeps down onto `Amount`) → `ai-tracking-box` restyled as a plain outline (offsets baked at setup; size morphed via scale, never width/height)
- 3D card subtle float; near-imperceptible tilt/scale drift on holds → `sine-wave-loop` (+ `multi-phase-camera`'s drift for the camera-side micro-motion; the _tilt_ component of the drift belongs to `3d-camera-flight`)
- camera drift toward a button; slow subtle zoom-ins riding a hold → `multi-phase-camera` (steady-push mode, tiny spread)

**camera grammar** (the defining layer — this blueprint IS its camera): every leg is a tween on ONE camera state (`viewport-change`'s single `.world` wrapper / `cam` object), sequenced by `multi-phase-camera`, aimed by `coordinate-target-zoom`. Legs must be _motivated_: sub-shape A moves because an action fired (click → swoop to the consequence); sub-shape B moves because the next reveal demands it (dive → focus → reposition → final dive). Vary the leg verbs — a journey of four identical pushes reads as a slideshow. Ease law: hard `out`-family on dives and landings (`power4.out` — violent arrival, sharp settle), `power2.inOut` on repositioning legs; spring/back easing on a camera feels wrong (per `multi-phase-camera`). Sub-shape B layers `3d-camera-flight`'s perspective wrapper under the same single-state discipline.

**Seek-safety (non-negotiable for this much camera):** the entire journey — every leg, every blur envelope, every DoF pull — lives on the ONE paused GSAP timeline, so any frame seek reproduces the exact mid-leg camera pose. One camera state object, transform composed in a single writer (`applyCamera()`), no CSS `transition` anywhere near the wrapper, blur via proxy-tweened attributes / `--dof` vars (both seek-safe), and ending mid-dive is fine — a seek to the last frame just lands mid-tween. Per-leg targets are measured ONCE at setup (after `fonts.ready`) and baked; never `getBoundingClientRect` in `onUpdate`.

**Overflow (required for a clean `check`):** a traveling camera deliberately moves world content past the frame edges on every leg. Keep `overflow: hidden` on the scene root AND mark the moving `.world` wrapper with `data-layout-allow-overflow` — otherwise `check` reports `text_box_overflow` / `container_overflow` for every panel the journey leaves behind (see the same note on `device-surface-showcase`).

# Counting with Dynamic Scale

A number counts from A → B while its transform scale grows to the final size — escalating visual weight ("this is impressive") without tweening `font-size` or forcing text layout on every frame. The final font size is static CSS; only the transform changes.

## How It Works

Two synchronized tweens at the SAME timeline position with the SAME ease: (1) a proxy value rendered as text via `onUpdate` (`Math.round(...).toLocaleString()`), (2) the counter's transform `scale: START_SCALE → 1`, where `START_SCALE = START_SIZE / END_SIZE`. A suffix (`%`, `×`, `+`) slides in AFTER the count lands — the number gets its own beat — and a label fades in early.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip (hyperframes-core) -->
<div class="counter-wrap">
  <span class="counter" id="counter">0</span><span class="counter-suffix">{suffix}</span>
</div>
<div class="counter-label">{label}</div>
```

```css
.counter-wrap {
  display: flex;
  align-items: baseline;
  justify-content: center;
  width: {counterContainerWidth}; /* fixed width — no layout shift as digit count changes */
}
.counter {
  font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums; /* MANDATORY — digits keep equal width */
  display: inline-block;
  font-size: {endSize}; /* final size is static; GSAP animates scale, not font-size */
  transform-origin: center center;
}
.counter-suffix {
  opacity: 0;
  transform: translateY(20px);
}
```

```js
const counter = document.getElementById("counter");
const state = { value: 0 };
const START_SCALE = START_SIZE / END_SIZE;

// Count value — onUpdate changes text only
tl.to(
  state,
  {
    value: TARGET_VALUE,
    duration: COUNT_DUR,
    ease: COUNT_EASE,
    onUpdate: () => {
      counter.textContent = Math.round(state.value).toLocaleString();
    },
  },
  0,
);

// Visual growth — compositor transform sharing the count's timing + ease
tl.fromTo(counter, { scale: START_SCALE }, { scale: 1, duration: COUNT_DUR, ease: COUNT_EASE }, 0);

// Suffix slides in AFTER the count completes
tl.to(
  ".counter-suffix",
  { opacity: 1, y: 0, duration: SUFFIX_DUR, ease: `back.out(${SUFFIX_BOUNCE_FACTOR})` },
  COUNT_DUR,
);

// Label fades in early
tl.from(".counter-label", { opacity: 0, y: 12, duration: LABEL_DUR, ease: "power2.out" }, LABEL_AT);
```

## Variations

- **Direct `innerText` tween (no proxy)** — GSAP can tween `innerText` directly for a number-only counter; keep the proxy form when you need locale formatting or suffix logic. The scale tween stays separate either way:

```js
tl.to(
  counter,
  { innerText: TARGET_VALUE, duration: COUNT_DUR, ease: COUNT_EASE, snap: { innerText: 1 } },
  0,
);
```

- **3D depth entry** — add a `tl.from(".counter", { z: -300, ... }, 0)` push-in; requires `perspective` on `.counter-wrap` and `transform-style: preserve-3d` on the counter.
- **Multi-stat coordinated reveal** — 3 stats counting in parallel share the SAME ease, duration, and start position so they finish together (a chord, not an arpeggio). Each stat usually also needs a paired graphic (bar / ring / stars) — don't stop at the number; see [stat-bars-and-fills.md](stat-bars-and-fills.md).

## Values

| TARGET_VALUE          | 2–3 digits ideal                            | 4+ digits needs a wider container; must fit at END_SIZE without clipping      |
| START_SIZE / END_SIZE | START ≈ 40–60% of END                       | design inputs used once for START_SCALE; never tween either                   |

| COUNT_EASE            | `power2.out` / `power3.out` ⭐ / `expo.out` | shared by value + scale; more `.out` = more dramatic deceleration at the peak |
| SUFFIX_DUR            | 0.3–0.6s                                    | fires at `COUNT_DUR`, never during the count                                  |
| SUFFIX_BOUNCE_FACTOR  | 1.4–2.0                                     | overshoot is fine on the suffix (it's punctuation, not data)                  |
| LABEL_AT / LABEL_DUR  | AT < COUNT_DUR/2; 0.4–0.7s                  | label arrives before the count peaks                                          |

## Critical Constraints

- **`tabular-nums` mandatory** + fixed-width container as belt-and-suspenders — without them digit-count transitions (9 → 10 → 100) jitter as glyph widths change.
- **Never set `fontSize` in `onUpdate`** — final type size is static CSS; only the transform changes per frame. Keep `onUpdate` O(1): set text only, no style writes or DOM creation.
- **`Math.round`, not `Math.floor`** — halfway through the final integer should already display the final value.
- **Avoid `back.out` / `elastic.out` on the counter itself** — overshoot makes the number look unstable (it's data, not decoration). Grow in place, don't bounce.
- **Label is BIG TEXT, not a page-style caption** — a tiny paragraph under a hero-size number reads as visual noise in video. Display-size, uppercase, tracked: the label is part of the headline.

# Stat Bars & Fills

The graphics that give a stat **visual weight** beside its number: a small bar chart, a progress bar/ring filling to a percentage, or a star row filling to a fractional rating. Pair these with [counting-dynamic-scale.md](counting-dynamic-scale.md) (the number) for a complete stat scene.

**Layout blueprint — pick ONE and hold it across all stats:**

- **Single-focus** — one centered frame, the number is the hero, a ring or bar sits under/around it. Cleanest for a sequential reveal (stat 1 → stat 2 → stat 3 in the same frame).
- **Split-frame** — big number on the left, paired graphic on the right. Better when stats are shown together or each needs a distinct visual.

Don't mix blueprints between stats in one piece — that reads as inconsistent.

## Recipe

### 1 — Growth Bars (CSS `scaleY` stagger)

Bars grow from the baseline with a stagger; the last bar is the accent. Heights are authored in CSS (inline height per bar); GSAP only reveals `scaleY: 0 → 1` — never animate `height`.

```css
.bars {
  display: flex;
  align-items: flex-end;
  gap: 14px;
  height: 280px;
}
.bar {
  width: 48px;
  background: #3a4a64;
  transform: scaleY(0);
  transform-origin: bottom center; /* grow UP from the baseline, not from center */
}
.bar:last-child {
  background: #ffc300; /* accent the final/current bar */
}
```

```js
tl.to(".bar", { scaleY: 1, duration: 0.7, ease: "power3.out", stagger: 0.08 }, 0.3);
```

### 2 — Progress Fill

**Bar form** — `scaleX` from a left origin:

```css
.track {
  width: 520px;
  height: 16px;
  background: #1b263b;
  border-radius: 8px;
  overflow: hidden;
}
/* width:100% is REQUIRED — an absolutely-positioned fill with no width is 0px, and scaleX of 0 is
   still 0 → the bar renders invisible (automated gates may miss a zero-width scaled element). */
.fill {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  background: #ffc300;
  transform: scaleX(0);
  transform-origin: left center;
}
```

```js
const PCT = 0.92; // 92%
tl.to(".fill", { scaleX: PCT, duration: 1.0, ease: "power2.out" }, 0.3);
```

**Ring form** — measured stroke draw (mechanics in [svg-path-draw.md](svg-path-draw.md)):

```js
const ring = document.querySelector("#ring");
const LEN = ring.getTotalLength(); // measure, don't hard-code the circumference
ring.style.strokeDasharray = LEN;
ring.style.strokeDashoffset = LEN; // empty
// rotate the <circle> -90deg in CSS so the fill starts at 12 o'clock
tl.to(ring, { strokeDashoffset: LEN * (1 - 0.92), duration: 1.1, ease: "power2.out" }, 0.3);
```

### 3 — Star-Rating Fill (fractional)

A gold star row revealed left-to-right to a fractional value (e.g. 4.6 / 5) via a clip wipe over a gold layer sitting on a gray layer.

```html
<div class="stars">
  <div class="stars-gray">★★★★★</div>
  <div class="stars-gold" id="goldStars">★★★★★</div>
</div>
```

```css
.stars {
  position: relative;
  font-size: 64px;
  letter-spacing: 8px;
}
.stars-gray {
  color: #2b3548;
}
.stars-gold {
  position: absolute;
  inset: 0;
  color: #ffc300;
  width: 100%;
  clip-path: inset(0 100% 0 0);
}
```

```js
const RATING = 4.6,
  MAX = 5;
tl.to(
  "#goldStars",
  { clipPath: `inset(0 ${100 - (RATING / MAX) * 100}% 0 0)`, duration: 1.0, ease: "power2.out" },
  0.3,
);
```

- **`scaleY` / `scaleX` / `clipPath`, never `height`/`width` tweens** — author each bar's final height in CSS and scale from 0.
- **`transform-origin`** must be `bottom` (bars grow up) / `left` (fills grow right) — the default center origin scales from the middle and looks wrong.
- **`.fill` needs `width: 100%`** — a zero-width fill scaled by any factor is still invisible, and automated gates may miss it.
- **Measure, don't hard-code** — ring length via `getTotalLength()`; a hard-coded circumference breaks if the radius changes.
- **Match the number's timing** — the fill and the count-up peak together (same start + ease) so the stat resolves as one beat, not two; a paired counter's `onUpdate` must be O(1) (see [counting-dynamic-scale.md](counting-dynamic-scale.md)).
- **One accent hue, consistent blueprint** — see `hyperframes-creative/references/data-in-motion.md`.
